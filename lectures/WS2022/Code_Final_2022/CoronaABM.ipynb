    "### Overview \n",
    "- Each agent is a person\n",
    "- Agents are categorised into three age groups \n",
    "- Infection dynamics:\n",
    "    - A susceptible agent may catch the virus when in contact with an infectious agent. The probability to catch the virus is given by the infectiousness of the infectious agent.\n",
    "    - Upon becoming infected, the infection course (timing, type, and outcome) is determined stochastically based on distributions. These distributions are based on educated guesses or inferred from data. Some characteristics also depend on the age of the infected agent.\n",
    "- Agents are embedded in a fixed interaction network (here a Watts-Strogatz-Network). Links between agents (nodes) represent physical contact that may result in an spreading event from one agent to the other. All agents interact asynchronously with one of their neighbours in one time step. \n",
    "- Policies can be implemented and analysed to investigate their effectiveness: e.g.\n",
    "    - reducing the number of contacts in the network\n",
    "    - reduce contacts for symptomatic agents\n",
    "    - reduce infectiousness by wearing a mask\n",
    "\n",
    "The timestep of the simulation is 0.5 day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of agents is set to 1000 including children, adults (with low risk) and elderly (with higher risk)."
